# Infrared Signal Decoder & Transmitter for Embedded Systems

This project implements an IR signal transmitter and decoder using the **TM4C123GXL (Tiva-C)** microcontroller. It sends NEC protocol IR signals using a hand-soldered IR LED circuit and receives IR codes using a TSOP134 receiver module. Useful for controlling TVs or learning remote codes.

> Developed by **Yusuf Semo** ‚Äî built entirely from scratch using low-level C, GPIO, PWM, and UART. Designed for embedded learning, IR remote control emulation, and custom hardware development.

## üß† Features

- Sends **NEC IR protocol** with 4 custom hex values
- Uses **UART** terminal interface (115200 baud) to type commands like:  
  `send 20 DF 6A 95`
- Transmits each command **10 times** to increase reliability
- Receives IR codes using **input capture ISR** with microsecond resolution
- Fully built in **Code Composer Studio** for the TM4C123GXL
- Hand-soldered IR circuits on perfboard
- Modular, low-level embedded C (no `scanf`, no standard C library)

## üí° How It Works

### Transmitter (IR LED)
- Generates **38kHz carrier** using GPIO toggling
- NEC protocol: 9ms pulse + 4.5ms space ‚Üí 4 data bytes + stop bit
- Signal structure:
[9ms] [4.5ms] [bit 1] [bit 2] ... [bit 32] [stop]

Each command is repeated **10x** in a row to ensure the receiving TV or device catches at least one clean transmission.

### Receiver (IR Decode)
- TSOP134 output is connected to a GPIO input pin with **edge-time capture**
- **Wide Timer 2B ISR** captures timestamps of rising edges
- Compares timing gaps to detect logical '1' and '0' values
- Decodes into full 32-bit IR command

## üß™ Usage

### 1. Open in Code Composer Studio
- Clone or download the project
- Import as an **existing CCS project**
- Connect your TM4C123 LaunchPad

### 2. Flash the firmware

### 3. Open UART terminal (Tera Term / PuTTY)
- **Baud Rate**: 115200  
- Type this to send signal:
send 20 DF 6A 95

### 4. Aim the IR LED at your device (TV, etc.)

## üîß Wiring Overview

### IR Transmitter (TX)
- **IR333 LED** ‚Üí PC4 (GPIO)
- Resistor (100‚Äì220Œ©)
- No external driver needed (driven directly by GPIO)

### IR Receiver (RX)
- **TSOP134 OUT** ‚Üí PD1 (Wide Timer 2B CCP input)
- Powered by 5V
- Pull-down or series resistor to reduce spiking
